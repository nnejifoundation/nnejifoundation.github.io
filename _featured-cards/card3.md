I am from Cali, Colombia and graduating from Mount Airy High School to study Biology at Emory & Henry College. I plan to become a pharmacist or physician assistant as I admire both careers equally. My passion has always been near medicine, with my objective being to expand the health and wellness of the general population. I plan to play on the College Men's Soccer team, continuing weightlifting and other exercise.
