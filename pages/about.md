header_title: About
header_intro: The Monica Chibuogu Nneji Foundation was established by Monicaâ€™s children to honor her life. Monica faithfully followed Christ and dedicated her life to caring for others, in her long career as a registered nurse, as a champion for academic excellence, and as an advocate for people with special needs. We hope you will join us in continuing the great work Monica began in the community.
