header_title: About
header_intro: The Monica Chibuogu Nneji Foundation was established by Monicaâ€™s children to honor her life. Monica faithfully followed Christ and dedicated her life to caring for others, in her long career as a registered nurse, as a champion for academic excellence, and as an advocate for social justice. We hope you will join us in continuing the great work Monica began in the community.<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnejifoundation/nnejifoundation.github.io/gh-pages/assets/images/Monica_Chibuogu_Nneji_1500x2100_300.jpg" alt="Monica Chibuogu Nneji portrait" align="center" height="350" width="250" ><figcaption>Monica Chibuogu Nneji, RN, BSN</figcaption></figure>
