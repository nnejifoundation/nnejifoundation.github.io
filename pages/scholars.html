  <p>The Monica Chibuogu Nneji Foundation (MCNF) identifies and invests in future health care professionals who are innovative, inclusive, resilient, and driven to improve health equity in their communities. The MCNF College Scholarship is designed to support students pursuing higher education in health care fields such as nursing, medicine, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, public health, and biomedical engineering. The Foundation awards each scholar with a scholarship of up to $500.00 based on unmet financial need paid directly to the scholar's institution for one semester as well as professional mentorship throughout their academic journey. The inaugural class of MCNF College Scholars are presented below.</p>
